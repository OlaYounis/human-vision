# human-vision
this is a basic model for how humans do see the real world around them.
the idea is to display each image in full resolution in the center and with blurry resolution at the peripheral.
human being sees full details using their central vision. we see big contrasts, recognize motion and colors using our peripheral vision.
In this tutorial, I used image processing to create 2 ellipses, one on the top of a blurry image and the other one is on the top of the original one.
then, I used the bitwise-and in order to blend them togather.
